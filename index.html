        <h2>Possibilities</h2>
        The decision to create a white label solution versus a unique domain and hosting for each individual website will depend on several factors. Here are some points to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>Scalability: If you plan to have a large number of self-employed people using your app, a white label solution may be easier to scale, as you can reuse the same website template and simply change the branding and content for each individual user. However, if you plan to have a smaller number of users, it may be more practical to create a unique domain and hosting for each website.</li><br>
            <li>Branding: If you want to maintain consistent branding for all the websites created using your app, a white label solution may be a good option. This can help create a sense of trust and reliability for users who may be using your app to build their online presence. However, if branding is not a concern and you want to give users full control over their website, individual domain and hosting may be a better option.</li><br>
            <li>Pricing: A white label solution may be easier to price as a fixed rate for each website, since you would be using the same template and hosting solution for each user. However, if you offer individual domain and hosting, you may need to price each website separately, which could be more complex.</li><br>
            <li>Customization: If you offer a white label solution, users may have less control over the design and functionality of their website, as they would be using a pre-defined template. However, if you offer individual domain and hosting, users would have full control over their website and can customize it to their specific needs.</li><br>
